# stuff-and-things
These directories will contain small scripts and tools for random tinkery purposes. For the most part, the scripts in here  
were developed as a means to a functionality. As such, they are very break-fixy in nature, and should not be taken as  
'production quality.' Nevertheless, they are there to help out with small stuff.  

## Getting started
For the most part, these scripts are all written and tested on a mid-2015 MacBook Air running macOS 10.13 and using  
Python 2.7.13 as the interpreter. Nothing special is necessary outside of the packages listed in the requirements.txt.

## Project Structure
Currently, the directory has two main subdirectories. They are:
* blufor - contains scripts meant for hardening servers
* opfor - contains scripts meant for intel gathering and exploitation


### Examples: Code in Action
To-do.

## Future Steps
Ideally, the next additions to this directory would be among the following:
* Update all code for Python 3 (potentially adding six for compatibility)
* Expand readme
